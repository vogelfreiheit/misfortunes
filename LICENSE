Do whatever you want, except printing these on stickers or t-shirts
to sell on Redbubble or Etsy for your pre-diabetic hipster friends.

If any of this offends you, I also accept no liability for your lack
of psychological fortitude, but in the words of Ash, the asshole robot
from Alien, "you have my sympathies".

E-hugs!
