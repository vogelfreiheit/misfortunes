To me, adventure is a concept that applies only to those men and women of
earlier historical times, like the mediaeval knights who travelled into
the unknown. The concept has degenerated constantly since then... I
absolutely loathe adventurers, and I particularly hate this old
pseudo-adventurism where the mountain climb becomes about confronting
the extremes of humanity.

One final paragraph of advice: do not burn yourselves out. Be as I am a
reluctant enthusiast... a part-time crusader, a half-hearted fanatic. Save the
other half of yourselves and your lives for pleasure and adventure. It is not
enough to fight for the land; it is even more important to enjoy it. While you
can. While it's still here. So get out there and hunt and fish and mess around
with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, climb the
mountains, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breathe deep of that yet sweet and
lucid air, sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness, the
lovely, mysterious, and awesome space. Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your
head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive, and I
promise you this much; I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies,
over those desk-bound men and women with their hearts in a safe deposit box,
and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this; You will
outlive the bastards.

My guess is that well over eighty per cent of the human race goes through life
without ever having a single original thought. That is to say, they never think
anything that has not been thought before, and by thousands.
A society made up of individuals who were all capable of original thought would
probably be unendurable. The pressure of ideas would simply drive it frantic.
The normal human society is very little troubled by them. Whenever a new one
appears the average man displays signs of dismay and resentment, The only way
he can take in such a new idea is by translating it crudely into terms of more
familiar ideas. That translation is one of the chief functions of politicians,
not to mention journalists. They devote themselves largely to debasing the ideas
launched by their betters. This debasement is intellectually reprehensible, but
probably necessary to carry on the business of the world.

mute, a docile second! He may think, as Walpole argues, that "life is too strong, too clever
and too remorseless for the sons of men," but he does not think that they are too weak and
poor in spirit to challenge it. It is the challenging that engrosses him, and enchants him,
and raises up the magic of his wonder. It is as futile, in the end, as Hamlet's or Faust's
—but still a gallant and a gorgeous adventure, a game uproariously worth the playing, an
enterprise "inscrutable ... and excessively romantic."...
