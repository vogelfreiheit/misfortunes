Fortune has plenty of sarcastic and obscene quotes for the joy of bored
system administrators and users alike, but very few packages exist which
contain something more palatable for the cultivated mind (the kind of
person that does not keep up with the Kardashians and their STD count,
for example). Let's just say that poo jokes and innuendo about genitalia
won't cut it. Nobody wants to read someone else's failed attempt at being
clever, either. What do!?

The cynical and misanthropic souls out there deserve something better...
much better.

Welcome to "misfortune". 100% lab tested, proven words from people
that will make you stop thinking about your retirement plan and realize
you wasted your life away and it all sucks, your wife got fat, your kids
hate you... and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it, because
your mom and dad lied to you and we're all here to eat shit and die, no
matter what Dr. Phil says. Feeling better already? I sure hope so!

If you would rather read the wits of folk like Mencken, the scathing
anti-sentimentalism of Conrad, or the wacky observations of Thompson,
use this file and enjoy some other type of intellectual bullshit. It
doesn't mean any of it is true, but then again, who fucking cares?
It's just big words from dead people, right!? It's OK, pilgrim.

Milleage might vary. Piss off Twitter, you millennial mad cunt, and
go read some books, maybe? You don't need to be able to point
Mexico on the map... until you do.

Your friendly neighborhood misanthrope,
